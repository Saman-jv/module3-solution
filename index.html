          <p>
            Not only is beef delicious and nutritious, but the beef industry
            continues to implement numerous proven sustainability practices
            throughout each and every step of the pasture-to-plate process that
            contribute to the way beef is responsibly raised today. Though the
            path to sustainability is never complete. It is a continuous journey
            being carried out by farmers and ranchers responsible for raising
            and supplying beef to the U.S. and across the world. To the beef
            community, sustainability comprises much more than environmental
            considerations. Today, a sustainable food supply balances efficient
            production with environmental, social and economic impacts. A
            sustainable food system is comprised of three different, but
            intersecting, pillars: social responsibility, economic viability and
            environmental stewardship. True sustainability is a balance of these
            three aspects. Beef farmers and ranchers are dedicated to producing
            beef in a way that prioritizes the planet, people, animals, and
            progress.

          <h3 class="ch" id="ch">Chicken</h3>
          <p>
            (Gallus domesticus) are domestic birds that cannot fly. There are
            over 150 different breeds of chicken that come in various colors,
            patterns and sizes. The chicken is believed to have descended from
            the wild Indian and south-east Asian Red Junglefowl which is
            biologically classified as the same species. With a population of
            more than 24 billion in 2003, there are more chickens in the world
            than any other bird. Chickens provide two sources of food frequently
            consumed by humans: their meat, also known as chicken, and eggs
            which they lay. Chickens have a great usefulness to humans. Chickens
            can be kept as pets, for breeding, egg laying and a food product.
            There are many different breeds that come in a variety of colors.
            They are commonly farmed all over the world.

          <h3 class="su" id="su">Sushi</h3>
          <p>
            Originally, sushi was a form of preserving fish, introduced to Japan
            in the 8th century from Southeast Asia; this involved wrapping a
            piece of gutted fish in fermented rice. This allowed for fish to be
            stored for several months, but surprisingly, the rice was thrown
            away. Later, the preserved fish was eaten with rice, Japans staple
            food, and was called nare-zushi, which can still be found today.
            Over the years, nare-zushi evolved according to each regions
            specialities; in Osaka, oshi-zushi became popular, while Shiga is
            still renowned for its funa-zushi from Lake Biwa. Haya-zushi, or
            quick sushi, was invented during the early 19th century by Hanaya
            Yohei (there is a Japanese chain restaurant named after him), and
            this is the form of sushi that is known worldwide today, now called
            nigiri-zushi. Fresh fish from Edo Bay (present day Tokyo) was eaten
            with vinegared rice, and sushi yatai (food stalls) emerged all over
            Tokyo. It has been theorized that this form of sushi became popular
            throughout Japan due to the 1923 Kanto Earthquake, which resulted in
            the Tokyo sushi chefs evacuating back to their hometowns and
            spreading the sushi culture there.
